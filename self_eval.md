# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
Honestly, I feel very confident! I retained this information fairly quickly!
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
I am very confident on my abilities. Creating my own methods was really fun.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
Is there a limit to how many strings you can add when defining a method?
